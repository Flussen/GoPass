# Disclaimer for GoPassOpen

By using GoPassOpen, you agree to the terms and conditions set out in this disclaimer. It is important to read and understand this document before using the software.

## 1. Development Stage
GoPassOpen is an ALPHA phase project and is under active development. As such, the software may contain bugs or deficiencies that could affect its operation. Users are advised to use GoPassOpen with caution and not as the sole solution for managing passwords and sensitive data.

## 2. Intended Use
GoPassOpen is designed to store user credentials, cards, and important files using web technologies and Golang. Although the software is intended for any use, users should assess whether it meets their specific security and functionality requirements.

## 3. Limitations and Compatibility
There is a possibility that compatibility issues may arise with future versions until a standard is established with the complete release version 1.0.0. Users should be aware of these limitations and act accordingly.

## 4. Updates and Support
GoPassOpen is updated and maintained as a hobby project by its founders. The availability of future updates or rapid technical support is not guaranteed. Users should understand that the responsibility for keeping their credentials secure lies with them, especially given the open-source, unfunded nature of the project.

## 5. Security and Liability
The security of the credentials stored with GoPassOpen greatly depends on the user's proper use of the software. The software utilizes an embedded key-value database in the user's PC, which implies that data loss or unauthorized access to the database due to improper use or external attacks is not the responsibility of GoPassOpen's developers.

## 6. Transparency and Open Source
GoPassOpen is an open-source project. Users are encouraged to review the code and contribute to the project to improve its security and functionality. However, transparency does not imply a guarantee of perfection or immunity from vulnerabilities.

By downloading, installing, or using GoPassOpen, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this disclaimer, and accept its terms and the [License](https://github.com/Flussen/GoPass/blob/main/LICENSE). The use of GoPassOpen is entirely at your own risk.
